`gjbt` is a simple (temporary) wrapper for GopherJS to run tests in Chrome as opposed to NodeJS. It should be considered
to be a direct replacement for `gopherjs test`.

Running your tests in Chrome has a number of benefits:

* it is almost certainly the VM in which your code will ultimately run
* you have full access to the DOM

### Usage

```
$ gjbt myitcv.io/gjbt
ok      myitcv.io/gjbt  0.273s
PASS
```

### Requirements

* [GopherJS](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs)
* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) `>= 66`
* [`chromedriver`](http://chromedriver.chromium.org/) `>= 2.34`

### Test Requirements

(For now) A small wrapper is required around `TestMain` in each package to be tested. It is sufficient to copy
[`init_test.go`](https://github.com/myitcv/gjbt/blob/master/testdata/test.001/init_test.go), modifying the test package name, to your
package.

### DOM Access

See [the tests in `myitcv.io/react`](https://github.com/myitcv/react/blob/master/a_elem_test.go) for examples of DOM
access.

### TODO

* Switch from being GopherJS specific to also allowing WASM-based tests. At which point `gjbt` starts to stand for Go
  Javascript Browswer Test... Indeed at some point we'll need to consider whether the 'j' has any meaning at all!
