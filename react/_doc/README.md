### About

[`myitcv.io/react`](https://godoc.org/myitcv.io/react) is a set of [GopherJS](http://www.gopherjs.org/) bindings for Facebook's [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), a Javascript library for building user interfaces.

```
go get -u myitcv.io/react
```

See the [Changelog](changelog.md) for notices of significant updates.

### Current state

* All key aspects of React are covered in these bindings
* You can create a GopherJS React-based web app, write components, run and distribute your web app
* GopherJS React components can be integrated with existing React applications, or vice versa
* Examples to get you started, and `reactGen -init` to create a skeleton web app
* Beta; API surface _may_ change

Please [raise issues](https://github.com/myitcv/react/issues) if you find problems
